== Goal ==

In this project you should model all the information managed by a Fitness App.  
With this app users can search for nearby running routes or share their favorite routes.  
Map My Fitness saves data on pace, distance, and calories burned for GPS-based workouts; you can use this data to set new personal goals.  
Through the Map My Fitness community, users can join challenges as well as motivate friends.
